# Kindle Fire 2 Root and Lineage OS install guide
Special thanks to jsheradin for uploading his [Kindle Fire 2 Repo](https://github.com/jsheradin/otter2_misc). Without it, I wouldn't have been able to get anywhere with my old Kindle Fire 2nd Gen.

NOTE: You are responsible for whatever happens to your device during this process. This has only been tested on the Kindle Fire 2 non-HD version and is not guaranteed to work on any other version.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have a Kindle Fire 2nd Generation (non-HD!). 

On the home screen, if the first link is Newsstand, you have a 1st generation Kindle Fire. 

If the first link is Shop, then you have a 2nd generation Kindle: If your Kindle has volume buttons, then it is a 2nd gen HD. If it does not, then you have a 2nd gen non-HD.

**(Recommended)**: Use Linux over Windows. I had a much easier time with adb and fastboot on Ubuntu 22.04 than I did on Windows. It is possible, however I couldn't get it to work on my Windows system.

## Step 1: Rooting
